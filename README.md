# CS50
This repository is used to store my projects for CS50 AI course. All starter codes are from assignment of Harvard CS50 AI course. If you have any questions, feel free to email me @jennycaojcjc@gmail.com

Currently, this repository includes a tic-tac-toe game for using to play against AI.

In order to run the tic-tac-toe program, install pygame and download runner.py, tictactoe.py, and OpenSans-Regular.ttf. Initiate the game by running runner.py.
